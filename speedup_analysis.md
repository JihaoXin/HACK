# Speedup Analysis: Matrix Multiplication Performance Optimization

This analysis examines how factorizing matrix multiplications with different middle dimensions affects performance compared to standard matrix multiplications. "No SVD" serves as our baseline (two consecutive matrix multiplications), while "SVD" represents our optimized approach (three factorized matrix multiplications with a configurable middle dimension).

## Key Findings

1. **Significant Speedups Achieved**: SVD demonstrates speedups of up to **9.46x** for long sequences (4096) when using small middle dimensions.

2. **Optimal Middle Dimension**: Smaller middle dimensions (64-256) consistently provide the best performance across all sequence lengths:
   - For sequence lengths 64-256: optimal middle dimension ranges from 64 to 256
   - For sequence lengths 512-4096: the optimal middle dimension is consistently 64

3. **Scaling with Sequence Length**: The speedup advantage of SVD factorized matrix multiplication increases dramatically with sequence length:
   - At seq_len=64: maximum speedup of 1.16x
   - At seq_len=4096: maximum speedup of 9.46x

4. **Diminishing Returns with Large Middle Dimensions**: Middle dimensions larger than 1024 generally result in worse performance than the baseline for all sequence lengths.

## Optimal Configuration for Each Sequence Length

| Sequence Length | Best Middle Dimension | Maximum Speedup |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 64              | 64                   | 1.16x           |
| 128             | 256                  | 1.27x           |
| 256             | 256                  | 1.99x           |
| 512             | 128                  | 2.97x           |
| 1024            | 64                   | 6.07x           |
| 2048            | 64                   | 7.11x           |
| 4096            | 64                   | 9.46x           |

## Analysis by Sequence Length

### Short Sequences (64-256)
- For short sequences, the performance benefit of SVD factorization is modest (1.16x to 1.99x)
- The optimal middle dimension tends to be larger relative to the sequence length
- At seq_len=64, only small improvements are seen with any middle dimension
- At seq_len=256, we begin to see more substantial benefits (~2x speedup)

### Medium Sequences (512-1024)
- Significant performance improvements become evident (2.97x to 6.07x)
- The optimal middle dimension shifts downward to 64-128
- Performance becomes more sensitive to middle dimension selection
- Speedups are substantial enough to significantly impact application performance

### Long Sequences (2048-4096)
- Dramatic performance improvements (7.11x to 9.46x)
- The optimal middle dimension stabilizes at 64
- Very large middle dimensions (4096) can actually perform worse than the No SVD baseline
- The computational savings from SVD factorization become extremely significant

## Computational Complexity Analysis

The theoretical computational complexity of the experiments:

- **No SVD**: Two consecutive multiplications
  - First multiplication: O(seq_len × model_dim × model_dim) = O(seq_len × 4096²)
  - Second multiplication: O(seq_len × model_dim × seq_len) = O(seq_len² × 4096)
  - Total: O(seq_len × 4096² + seq_len² × 4096)

- **SVD**: Three factorized multiplications with middle dimension
  - Left branch: O(seq_len × model_dim × middle_dim) = O(seq_len × 4096 × middle_dim)
  - Right branch: O(middle_dim × model_dim × seq_len) = O(middle_dim × 4096 × seq_len)
  - Final multiplication: O(seq_len × middle_dim × seq_len) = O(seq_len² × middle_dim)
  - Total: O(seq_len × 4096 × middle_dim + middle_dim × 4096 × seq_len + seq_len² × middle_dim)

When middle_dim << model_dim, the computational advantage of SVD becomes significant, especially for large sequence lengths.

## Practical Implications

1. **For Transformer Models**: Using SVD factorized attention mechanisms with small middle dimensions can dramatically improve performance, especially for longer sequences.

2. **Architectural Design Choices**: The middle dimension parameter should be carefully tuned based on sequence length:
   - For applications with varying sequence lengths, a dynamic middle dimension selection could be beneficial
   - For fixed sequence length applications, selecting the optimal middle dimension can provide substantial speedups

3. **Hardware Utilization**: Smaller middle dimensions may better utilize GPU memory hierarchies and cache structures, explaining why the optimal middle dimension doesn't always scale with sequence length.

4. **Memory Bandwidth Optimization**: The SVD approach likely reduces memory bandwidth requirements by processing smaller matrices, which may explain the disproportionate benefits for larger sequence lengths.

## Recommendations

1. **Default Configuration**: For general use cases, a middle dimension of 64 provides the best overall performance across sequence lengths.

2. **Sequence Length Dependent Configuration**:
   - For seq_len < 256: Use middle_dim = 256
   - For seq_len ≥ 256: Use middle_dim = 64

3. **Performance Critical Applications**: For maximum performance, use the table of optimal configurations above to select the best middle dimension for your specific sequence length.

4. **Memory Constrained Environments**: The SVD approach not only improves computation time but may also reduce peak memory usage during matrix multiplication, making it suitable for memory-constrained environments.

## Conclusion

SVD factorization of matrix multiplications with appropriate middle dimensions can yield dramatic performance improvements, especially for longer sequence lengths. The benefits increase superlinearly with sequence length, suggesting that this optimization approach becomes increasingly valuable as models process longer sequences. For practical applications, using small middle dimensions (64-256) consistently provides the best performance, with middle_dim=64 being optimal for most sequence lengths over 512.
